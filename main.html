        <h3>LEGO 75301 Star Wars Luke Skywalkerâ€™s X-Wing Fighter</h3>
        <p>This was my first lego set I built. I got this set at the beginning of 2021 and built it the saem day I bought it. Honestly a very fun set to build. I think it had like around 450 peices from what I remember, but not too sure. I built this set because I'm a fan of the Star Wars Franchise, and I just thought this lego set looked really cool and the process of building it was cool to me.</p>
