            <h3>LEGO 75301 Star Wars Luke Skywalker’s X-Wing Fighter</h3>
            <p>This was my first lego set I built. 
                I got this set at the beginning of 2021 and built it the same day I bought it. 
                Honestly a very fun set to build. I think it had like around 450 pieces from what 
                I remember, but not too sure. I built this set because I'm a fan of the 
                Star Wars Franchise, and I just thought this lego set looked really cool 
                and the process of building it was cool to me.

                This is so far my favorite, I got it for Christmas, 
                gifted to me by my amazing girlfriend Zoey,
                I talked about how I liked lego sets and at first I thought 
                she was gonna think that was kind of childish of me, but 
                then she surprises me with this beauty of a lego set. 
                But yeah another awesome set, this one pretty much my favorite one, 
                it is super cool to look at, it has little bullets that actually shoot 
                out of the car. The mechanics on this car are pretty standard but pretty cool. 
                I thought the mechanics on the X-Wing were a bit better only cause the 
                wings are able to move and make that "X" look. But this car is just amazing, 
                the wheels move very good, overall look of the car is very clean and simple, 
                but still one hell of a Lego Set.
